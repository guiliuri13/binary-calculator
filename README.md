# Binary Calculator

This project came up with the aim of training logical reasoning, algorithms and calculations with binary numbers.

## Challenges
I decided not to use any ready syntax for calculations, nor conversion to decimal to perform the operations, in order to use the same method that we do when performing the calculation "by hand".

Initially i used node + typescript, and i had the intention of turning the project into an open-source API, but that will be in the not-too-distant future.

## How to use
Copy the script of the desired method, change the numbers in the indicated places, and run it in your preferred terminal (VS code, dev tools...). (hence the idea of ​​turning it into an api...)
